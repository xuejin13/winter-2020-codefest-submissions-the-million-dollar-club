Going to be focusing on Productivity
An idea that I have could possibly be creating a to-do list while using twillio bot that messages the user to remind them

I'm thinking of an ios app, user has to create their own acc that way it has their todo list. 

Schedule
Create a full stack application:
    Using parse and heroku

Change in idea:
    Creating an exercising app
    
        -User gets to select their workout
        -They choose the intensity
        -While user selects the workout, it displays the estimate time based on the exercise/ how many sets and reps they want to do
        -User follows the workout, when they finsih working out they tap the complete and rest timer comes in and does the countdown: when finished it notifies the user to do the next set. 
        -Repeat till finish.
        Extra: 
        -Create a small game:
        a little display: that shows the a stick avatar growing stronger as the user continues to use the app.

Layout

    -User authentication 
    -User sees the workout layout, on right hand corner the add sign to create a workout list
    -As they finish and come back to original home screen, theres a start and next exercise.
    -timer shows estimated time finish. / after
    -
