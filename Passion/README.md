Going to be focusing on Productivity
An idea that I have could possibly be creating a to-do list while using twillio bot that messages the user to remind them

I'm thinking of an ios app, user has to create their own acc that way it has their todo list. 

Schedule
Create a full stack application:
    Using parse and heroku
